/* This class provides a very simple implementation of a web server. As a web server
 * must be capable of handling multiple requests from web browsers at the same time,
 * it is essential that the server is threaded, i.e. that the web server can perform
 * tasks in parallel and serially (one request at a time, after another).
 * 
 * In programming languages, all network communication is handled using sockets. A 
 * socket is a software abstraction of a connection between one computer on a network
 * and another. A server-socket is a process that listens on a port number for 
 * incoming client requests. For example, the standard port number for a HTTP server (a
 * web server) is port 80. Most of the commonly used Java networking classes are 
 * available in the java.net package. The java.io package contains a set of classes
 * designed to handle Input/Output (I/O) activity. We will use both packages in the web
 * server class below.
